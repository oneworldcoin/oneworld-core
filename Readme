## üöÄ Deployment

Deployment script: `scripts/deploy.js`

Deployment command:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network bsc
 
### Preparing to deploy (safety checklist)

- Do NOT commit your real `PRIVATE_KEY` to the repository. Use the `.env.example` as a template and copy it to `.env` locally only.
- Create a fresh wallet (MetaMask or hardware wallet) and store the mnemonic safely offline. Fund it with enough BNB to cover deployment gas.
- Populate `.env` locally with your private key and RPC endpoint:

```text
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
BSC_RPC=https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/
```

- Test deployment on a testnet or local hardhat node before publishing to mainnet.
- After successful deployment, remove any private keys from local files and do not push them to remote.

If you want, the project maintainer can help prepare the repository so the only step you need is to paste your private key into `.env` locally and run the deploy command.
